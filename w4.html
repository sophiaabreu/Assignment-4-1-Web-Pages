    <h3>What are mountains?</h3>
    <p>Landform that rises prominently above its surroundings, generally exhibiting steep slopes, a relatively confined summit area, and considerable local relief.
        A mountain belt is many tens to hundreds of kilometres wide and hundreds to thousands of kilometres long.
        Individual mountains are connected by ridges and separated by valleys. Within many mountain belts are plateaus, which stand high but contain little relief.
        Thus, for example, the Andes constitute a mountain belt that borders the entire west coast of South America; within it are both individual ranges, such as the Cordillera Blanca in which lies Peru's highest peak, Huascar√°n, and the high plateau, the Altiplano, in southern Peru and western Bolivia.

<h3>How Are Mountains Formed?</h3>
<p>
    Mountains exist on every continent and even beneath our great oceans.  Some of the highest mountains are at the bottom of the sea.
    Mountains form where two continental plates collide. 
    Since both plates have a similar thickness and weight, neither one will sink under the other. Instead, they crumple and fold until the rocks are forced up to form a mountain range. As the plates continue to collide, mountains will get taller and taller.
</p>
<h4>There are five basic kinds of mountains:</h4>
<!--ol is for making lists of numbers-->
<ul>
    <ol>1. Fault-block Mountains (Block Mountains)</ol>
    <ol>2. Fold Mountains (Folded Mountains)</ol>
    <ol>3. Upwarped Mountains</ol>
    <ol>4. Volcanic Mountains</ol>
</ul>

<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<p>
    Terrains have higher elevations than do surrounding areas. Moreover, high relief exists within mountain belts and ranges.
    Chains of active volcanoes, such as those occurring at island arcs, are commonly marked by individual high mountains separated by large expanses of low and gentle topography.
    The folding of layers of sedimentary rocks with thicknesses of hundreds of metres to a few kilometres often leaves long parallel ridges and valleys termed fold belts, as, for example, in the Valley and Ridge province of Pennsylvania in the eastern United States.
    The crystalline terrains typically contain the highest peaks in any mountain belt and include the highest belt in the world, the Himalayas, which was formed by the thrusting of crystalline rocks up onto the surface of the Earth.
    Block faulting can occur when blocks are pushed over neighbouring valleys, as has occurred in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah in the western United States.
    Block faulting also occurs where blocks are pulled apart, causing a subsidence of the intervening valley between diverging blocks.

<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
<!--li is for making lists of bullets-->
<ul>
    <li>Any land mass that rises 1,000 feet above the surrounding area is considered a mountain.</li>
    <li>Some mountains are caused by volcanoes spewing lava over and over again. The lava cools and hardens and builds up to form a mountain.</li> 
    <li>The summit or peak is the highest point of a mountain.</li>
    <li>The Rocky Mountain range is the second longest in the world. It stretches more than 3,000 miles from northern Canada through the Southwestern United States.</li>
